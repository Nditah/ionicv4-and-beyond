## Introduction

[Fluster](https://fluster.io/), your simple and open source search for roommates has been recently upgraded to [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) v4.

In this talk, I will highlight some key features of this new version of the framework and will also introduce some concepts like web components, shadow dom, slots or css4 variables which comes along.

Finally, instead of a standard demo, once we will have been through the slides, we will begin again and have a look at the code of the presentation, because these slides are actually an `index.html` where `@ionic/core` is used ðŸ˜‰

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install the dependencies, build the talk and run a local server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterpeterparker/ionicv4-and-beyond
cd ionicv4-and-beyond
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```
