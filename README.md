## Introduction

[Fluster](https://fluster.io/), your simple and open source search for roommates has been recently upgraded to [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) v4.

In this talk, I will highlight some key features of this new version of the framework and will also introduce some concepts like web components, shadow dom, slots or css4 variables which comes along.

Finally, I will try to wrap everything in a quick demo.

## Features

* The slides of the talk are build with `@ionic/core` in a plain `index.html` file ðŸ˜‰

* [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) is used to serve the slides

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterpeterparker/ionicv4-and-beyond
cd ionicv4-and-beyond
npm install
npm run dev
```
